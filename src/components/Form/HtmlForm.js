<span>A. PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE)</span>
<div id="description"> The AHKA (2016) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Young People recommends the delivery of at least 150 minutes per week of scheduled PE classes and organised school sports activities to all students, which are compulsory. For the purpose of this instrument, best practice is considered the delivery of 120 minutes of scheduled PE classes every week.
    In addition, the following are also used as indicators of best practice in this section:
    • delivery of all scheduled PE classes for all students by a tertiary qualified PE specialist teacher.
    • teacher/student ratio in PE lessons about the same to that of other subjects.
    • a minimum of one professional development session per year specifically targeting PE for school staff who teach PE.
    • not withholding PE as punishment.
    Note: A specialist PE teacher is a teacher who has completed a tertiary qualification in PE.
