            <p class="help-block">The AHKA (2016) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Young People recommends the delivery of at least 150 minutes per week of scheduled PE classes and organised school sports activities to all students, which are compulsory. For the purpose of this instrument, best practice is considered the delivery of 120minutes of scheduled PE classes every week.  In addition, the following are also used as indicators of best practice in this section: 1. delivery of all scheduled PE classes for all students by a tertiary qualified PE specialist teacher. 2. teacher/student ratio in PE lessons about the same to that of other subjects. 3. a minimum of one professional development session per year specifically targeting PE for school staff who teach PE. 3. not withholding PE as punishment.  Note: A specialist PE teacher is a teacher who has completed a tertiary qualification in PE.

        <div class="form-group">
            <p class="help-block">The AHKA (2016) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Young People
recommends allocating at least 60 minutes for recess / lunchtime play every
day, during which students can be active if they wish.
Additionally, research suggests that several strategies (i.e., best practices) can help
increase physical activity in recess / lunchtime (Beighle, 2010, 2012 CDC &amp; SHAPE
America, 2017 Ickes, Erwin, &amp; Beighle, 2013 Ridgers et al., 2012), including:
• Providing inexpensive playground equipment (e.g., balls, skipping
ropes, etc.)
Using planned activities (e.g., activities for the week) or activity cards
• Painting playground surfaces with lines for recreation games (e.g.,
four square, hopscotch) or murals (e.g., castles, dragons, mazes)
• Allocating playground space for designated ‘activity zones’
• Teaching playground games during PE
• Training recess supervisors to teach new games and interact with
students
• Involving students in planning and/or leading recess / lunchtime play
• Combining several approaches
Another indicator of best practice used in this section involves not withholding
recess / lunchtime play as punishment.
Considering that Australian schools typically have two, or sometimes even three,
recess / lunchtime breaks during the school day, optimal practice is considered
implementing the above strategies during all recess / lunchtime breaks.</p>

            <p class="help-block">• Intra-school sport refers to sport sessions or competitions offered to students
enrolled in your school (e.g. Friday afternoon sport).
• Inter-school sport refers to organised sport competitions in which your school
competes against other schools.
For the purposes of the SPAI, best practice for the provision of intra-school sport is
considered providing intra-school sport for students in Years 4-6 at least 30
minutes each week. This is based on the AHKA (2016) Report Card on Physical
Activity for Children and Young People recommendation for the delivery of at least
150 minutes per week of scheduled PE classes and organised school sports
activities to all students, and the use of 120 minutes of scheduled PE classes as best
practice in section A.
Additional indicators of best practices used in this section involve organising
regular sports carnivals, and not withholding sport as punishment.</p>

        <div class="form-group">
            <p class="help-block">Classroom physical activity can include:
(a) integrating physical activity within lessons to teach/reinforce academic
content (e.g. active revisions active curriculum concepts), or
(b) incorporating short stand-alone physical activity breaks between/within
lessons (e.g. stretching or dancing to a video routine).
Research suggests that several factors can influence the implementation of
classroom physical activity by classroom teachers (Webster et al., 2015), including:
• A supportive environment (e.g., support by peer groups, online
communities of practice, PE teacher, administrators, etc.).
• The provision of relevant training.
• The provision of resources – particularly ones with brief activities that
are predominantly connected to academic content.
While there is no recommendation best practice in this area, for the purpose of this
instrument, best practice is considered integrating physical activity in the
classroom for a minimum of 15 minutes throughout the school day.</p>

during the school day. These may include fun runs/walks, walkathons, field days,
Jump Rope for Heart events, or HPE week events. While there is no
recommendation for best practice in this area, for the purpose of this instrument,
best practice is considered having an additional physical activity event at least

        <div class="form-group">
            <p class="help-block">Several factors influence active transport to/from school, including distance,
safety, and school infrastructure (AHKA, 2015). Accordingly, several strategies
have been proposed for schools to encourage and facilitate active transport,
including:
• Identifying safe routes to/from school
• Providing crossing guards or pedestrian crossing lights at
intersections
• Having a designated ‘car free’ zone and encouraging ‘park and
ride/walk’
• Having secure bike shelters and storage space for helmets and other
gear
• Engaging with the community to initiate walking/riding school groups
• Organising ‘walk to school’ or ‘bike to school’ days.
In addition to these strategies, we consider best practice the promotion of active
transport by school administration (e.g., in newsletters, etc.).</p>

        <div class="form-group">
            <p class="help-block">The before school and after school time periods can help students meet the daily
physical activity guidelines. Before and after school programs may include free
play on school grounds or organised programs such as walking and running clubs
(often called kilometre clubs), which can be facilitated by school personnel,
parents/volunteers, or even community-based organisations. Such opportunities
provide students the option to be physically active rather than being sedentary
while waiting for the school day to begin or after school.
The AHKA (2016) Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Young People
recommends that schools offer additional physical activity/sports programs to all
students outside of school hours. While there are no specific guidelines about best
practice for before school and after school physical activity, for the purpose of this
instrument best practice is considered:
• allowing children to be active for a minimum of 30 minutes before
school and a minimum of 30 minutes after school every day,
• providing supervision for a minimum of 30 minutes before school and
a minimum of 30 minutes after school every day, and
• having organised physical activity opportunities and/or equipment
before or after school at least three times a week for 30 minutes each
time.</p>

        <div class="form-group">
            <p class="help-block">The process of assessing school physical activity practices, developing goals for improvement and making relevant plans is more likely to be efficient when a school has a school physical activity committee with a diverse group of members. It is also typical for such a committee to have a leader, who may be the PE teacher, the school physical activity or sport coordinator, another school physical activity champion, or even an individual outside the school community (e.g., volunteer, graduate student, etc.).
This committee may have different names (e.g., health or wellness committee, sport committee, etc.) and may have a broader scope than just focusing on physical activity, but it is essential that committee members meet regularly. Committee members may include HPE teachers, classroom teachers, administrators, other school staff (e.g., nurse), students, parents, and other community stakeholders (e.g. representatives from local or regional organisations, health departments, etc).
The formation of such a committee is an essential element of whole-of-school physical activity models worldwide, and is often recommended as a first step in the process of developing multi-component school physical activity programs (CDC, 2013 McMullen et al., 2015). This committee’s responsibilities involve developing a school physical activity plan, overseeing its implementation, and regularly evaluating and updating the plan.
Therefore, for the purposes of this instrument, best practice is considered:
• Having a committee that meets regularly (at least twice per term) about physical activity promotion and is representative of key school stakeholders.
• Having a formal leader overseeing the function of the committee.
• Having a school physical activity plan that is fully implemented, and regularly (at least once per year) evaluated and updated
.
Note: Representative here means including, as a minimum, a school administrator, a PE teacher, classroom teacher representative(s), student representative(s), and parent/community representative(s).

• Encouraging the integration of physical activity in the classroom.
• Encouraging active transport to/from school.
• Requiring all scheduled PE classes to be delivered by a tertiary qualified PE specialist teacher.
• Requiring school staff to receive training on supporting physical activity during recess/lunchtime, before/after school, or intra-school sport.
• Prohibiting school staff from using physical activity as punishment  and withholding physical activity opportunities (e.g., PE or recess) aspunishment (e.g., for poor behaviour or unfinished academic work).
• Allowing play in the shade when students forget their hat (rather than observing a ‘no hat, no play’ policy).

        <div class="form-group">
            <p class="help-block">Families and other community stakeholders can support school-based physical activity program in various ways. Parents/guardians can positively influence children’s and adolescents’ physical activity, and they can support physical activity in/around the school day by volunteering or participating in HPE or other physical activity and sporting events. Community partnerships can help maximise school and community resources, and can provide children with additional community- based physical activity opportunities. Community organisations (e.g., Heart Foundation - Jump Rope for Heart programme, Australian Sports Commission, National and State Sporting Organisations, local sports clubs, YMCAs, etc.) can often provide physical activity and/or sporting programs before, during, or after school.
While there are no guidelines about best practice for family and community engagement, for the purpose of this instrument best practice is considered:
• Organising family physical activity or sporting events once a term.
• Having a partnership with at least two community physical activity or
sporting organisations every academic year.
• Making your school’s indoors and outdoors physical activity facilities
available for use by community members and/or organisations outside of school hours.

            <p class="help-block">The availability of funding is important for the purposes of purchasing, maintaining, or replacing facilities, equipment, and other resources necessary to support school physical activity opportunities. Funding is also necessary for supporting staff professional development in the area of physical activity promotion. Beyond internal (i.e., school) funding, however, external funding can also be accessed to support physical activity opportunities at a school. Best practice, therefore, is considered:
• Having a budget for physical activity related expenses every year.
• Providing financial support for the professional development of PE teachers and other school staff in the area of physical activity promotion.
• Applying for funding to support physical activity opportunities from at least one external source every year.
